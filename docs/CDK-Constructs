## CDK Constructs

##### 1. L1 - Low Level Constructs

- Cfn (Cloud Formation) resources. When used, we must configure all required properties.
- Most AWS resources are migrated to L2. Use for new services that are still not migrated.
- Simple constructs - CfnOutput

##### 2. L2 - AWS resources with a higher level

- CDK provides additional functionality like defaults, boiler plate and type safety for many paramters
- Used most of the time

##### 3. L3 - Patterns

- Combine multiple types of resources and help with common tasks in AWS.
- Examples: LambdaRestApi
- Used depending on company policy and matter of preference.
